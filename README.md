## üì• Installation
JSDataStructures is available through [Swift Package Manager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app). Simply add the line below in your Package.swift dependencies.
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/jaysack/JSDataStructures", from: "1.0.0"),
```
Once this is done, import the library as follow in your Swift file:
```swift
import JSDataStructures
```
<br>

## üìö Simple Structures
### Stack
A **Stack** is what its name says it is: a stack!\
It does conform to Apple's `Sequence` protocol and as such, gives you access to a large number of operations that you can perform on any sequence.
```swift
var stack = Stack<Int>()

stack.push(4)
stack.push(8)
stack.push(9)

// Visual Representation ---> BOTTOM | 4 - 8 - 9 | TOP

stack.pop()

// Visual Representation ---> BOTTOM | 4 - 8 | TOP
```
<br>

Although this implementation works perfectly, you can take advantage of the `ExpressibleByArrayLiteral` protocol the stack conforms to and instantiate it with an array instead like in the example below:
```swift
var stack: Stack<Int> = [4, 8, 9]
```

### Queue
A **Queue** is a pretty self-explanatory `Sequence` that allows you to:
- `enqueue(_ value: T)` an element are the end of the queue
- `dequeue()` an element from the beginning of the queue
```swift
var queue = Queue<String>()

queue.enqueue("Andre")
queue.enqueue("Kate")
queue.enqueue("Bob")
queue.enqueue("Tajea")

// Visual Representation ---> FRONT | Andre - Kate - Bob - Tajea | BACK

queue.dequeue()

// Visual Representation ---> FRONT | Kate - Bob - Tajea | BACK

```

## üîó Lists
The lists structures in **JSDataStructures** are implemented on top of the `Node` class to create references between list items.
<br>
### Node
A node has the following properties:
- `value`   : its payload
- `prev`     : its reference to its previous node
- `next`     : its reference to its following node

Please note, the reference to the next node is a `weak` reference to avoid retain cycles.\
It makes it easier to detach the last node in the list by assigning it a `nil` value (as opposed to breaking both references between the nodes).

```swift
let aNode = Node<String>("A")
let bNode = Node<String>("B")

aNode.next = bNode

bNode = nil // No retain cycle here, the object is deallocated from memory üôÇ
```

### Doubly Linked List
The **DoublyLinkedList** implementation in **JSDataStructure** adds and removes its extremity nodes with a time complexity of *O(1)* while insertion a node at a specific index will give you a time complexity of *O(n)*.

#### Adding Elements
```swift
var list = DoublyLinkedList<Int>()

list.append(7)          // O(1)
// Visual Representation ---> | 7 |

list.push(4)            // O(1)
list.push(1)            // O(1)
// Visual Representation ---> | 1 - 4 - 7 |

list.insert(9, at: 2)   // O(n)
// Visual Representation ---> | 1 - 4 - 9 - 7 |
```
<br>

#### Removing Elements
```swift
let a = list.pop()        // O(1)
// a = 1
// Visual Representation ---> | 4 - 9 - 7 |

list.popLast()            // O(1)
// Visual Representation ---> | 4 - 9 |

list.remove(at: 1)        // O(n)
// Visual Representation ---> | 4 |
```
<br>

**DoublyLinkedList** conforms to the `ArrayLiteralElement` to make its instantiation more readable.
```swift
let list: DoublyLinkedList<String> = ["a", "b", "c"]
```

<br>

### LRU Cache
**JSDataStructures** gives you a fast **LRU Cache** with O(1) operations for both checking and inserting values.
```swift
// Instantiate
lruCache = LRUCache<Int>(capacity: 2)

lruCache.insert(3)      // ---> 3
lruCache.insert(7)      // ---> 7 - 3
lruCache.insert(8)      // ---> 8 - 7

lruCache.contains(7)    // ---> 7 - 8
```

## üå≤ Trees
A tree is a hierarchical data structure with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of **TreeNode** generic objects.
Each **TreeNode** owns a reference to its parent (if any) and its children

```swift
let root = TreeNode<Int>(4)
let one = TreeNode<Int>(1)
let seven = TreeNode<Int>(7)

root.insert(one)
root.insert(seven)

let childrenValue = root.children.map { $0.value }
print(childrenValue)        // ---> [1, 7]

print(seven.parent.value)   // ---> 4
print(root.parent)          // ---> nil
```

Trees in **JSDataStructures** comes in three different forms:
- Simple Tree: using a **TreeNode** as node object
- Binary Searh Tree: using a **BSTNode** as node object
- Self-balancing Binary Searh Tree: using an **AVLNode** as node object **(COMING SOON)**
<br>

### Simple Tree
A tree node has the following properties
- `value`    : its payload
- `parent`   : its reference to its parent node
- `children` : its reference to its children nodes

Please note, like in the linked node, that the reference to the parent node is a `weak` reference to avoid retain cycles.

### Binary Search Tree
A **BSTNode** is a node inheriting from the **TreeNode** class.
However, a BSTNode can only have at most two children:
- one **left** child with a value smaller than the node payload  
- one **right** child with a value higher than the node payload

This small but important distinction between the two, allows for a much faster interactions in Binary Search Trees
