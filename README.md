## üì• Installation
JSDataStructures is available through [Swift Package Manager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app). Simply add the line below in your Package.swift dependencies.
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/jaysack/JSDataStructures", from: "1.0.0"),
```
Once this is done, import the library as follow in your Swift file:
```swift
import JSDataStructures
```
<br>

## üìö Simple Structures
### Stack
A **Stack** is what its name says it is: a stack!
It does conform to Apple's `Sequence` protocol and as such, gives you access to a large number of operations that you can perform on any sequence.
```swift
var stack = Stack<Int>()
stack.push(4)
stack.push(8)
stack.push(9)
// Visual Representation ---> BOTTOM - 4 - 8 - 9 - TOP
```

Although this implementation works perfectly, you can take advantage of the `ExpressibleByArrayLiteral` protocol the stack conforms to and instantiate it with an array instead like in the example below:
```swift
var stack: Stack<Int> = [4, 8, 9]
```

<br>

### Queue
A **Queue** is a pretty self-explanatory `Sequence` that allows you to `enqueue()` and `dequeue()` elements.

<br>

## üîó Lists
The lists structures in **JSDataStructures** are implemented on top of the `Node` class to create references between list items.
<br>
### Node
A list item with a `value`, a reference `prev` to the previous node, and a `next` reference to the following node.
Please note, the reference to the next node is a `weak` reference to avoid retain cycles.
It also makes it easier to detach the last node in the list by assigning it a `nil` value (as opposed to breaking both references between the nodes).
```swift
let aNode = Node<String>("A")
let bNode = Node<String>("B")

aNode.next = bNode
bNode.prev = aNode (Optional: you may not need this line depending on what you're working on)

bNode = nil // No retain cycle here, the object is deallocated from memory üôÇ 
```
<br>

### DoublyLinkedList
The **DoublyLinkedList** implementation in **JSDataStructure** adds and removes its extremity nodes with a time complexity of *O(1)* while insertion a node at a specific index will give you a time complexity of *O(n)*.
```swift
var list = DoublyLinkedList<Int>()

list.append(7)          // O(1)
list.push(4)            // O(1)
list.push(1)            // O(1)

list.insert(9, at: 2)   // O(n)
```
<br>

**DoublyLinkedList** conforms to the `ArrayLiteralElement` to make its instantiation more readable.
```swift
let list: DoublyLinkedList<String> = ["a", "b", "c"]
```
<br>

### LRU Cache
**JSDataStructures** gives you a *doubly linked list implementation* of the **Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache**.
Hence, accessing the least recently used item is executed in O(1) time complexity while accessing any other item is a time complexity of O(n).
```swift
// Instantiate
lruCache = LRUCache<Int>(capacity: 2)
lruCache.insert(3)  // ---> 3
lruCache.insert(7)  // ---> 7 - 3
lruCache.insert(8)  // ---> 8 - 7
```
> üí° While other implementations could give you a time complexity of O(1) to access any index this **LRU Cache** uses a Doubly Linked List as storage.

## üå≤ Trees
<img src="https://jaysack-github-readme.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jsconstraints/relative-constraints-example.png" alt="Pink constraints to left and bottom in Xcode simulator">

```swift
indigoView.setConstraints([
    .relWidth(view.widthAnchor) * .multiplier(0.4),
    .relHeight(pinkSquare.heightAnchor) * .multiplier(1.18)
])

// We're assuming here that the indigo view's in already in
// its superview's stack and has been constrained from its top and right sides.
```
<br>

#### What Just Happened?
We set the width of `indigoView` to be 0.4 times the size of  `view` width.\
We also set `indigoView` to be slightly taller than our `pinkSquare`.

> üí° `multiplier` argument is optional and replaced by 1 if not provided.

### Centering a View

```swift
yellowCircle.centerIn(superview: self.view)
```
<br>

#### What Just Happened?
We constrained `yellowCircle` in the **center** of the the screen.

### Pin to Superview
<img src="https://jaysack-github-readme.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jsconstraints/pin-to-superview-example.png" alt="Indigo view pinned to superview in Xcode simulator">

```swift
indigoView.pinTo(superview: self.view, withPadding: 18)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What About `UILayoutGuide` Cases?
Depending on your design, you may opt to pin your view to either your ViewController's `view` or it's `layoutGuide` as both are supported with JSConstraints.\
Using `layoutGuide` will automatically add a child view to the layout guide's owner view:
```swift
indigoView.pinTo(layoutGuide: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide)

// Indigo view was automatically added to `view` subviews
```
- - - -

## ‚ôªÔ∏è How About Dynamic Constraints?
JSConstraints methods always return the collection of successfully activated constraints.\
We can use it to toggle between  `active` and `inactive` states.
<br>

### 1. Get Active Constraints
```swift
// Save returned constraints
var pinkOptionalConstraints = pinkSquare.setConstraints([ bottomConstraint, leadingConstraint ])
var indigoOptionalConstraints = indigoView.setConstraints([ topConstraint, trailingConstraint ])

// Append to array of dynamic constraints
dynamicConstraints.append(contentsOf: pinkOptionalConstraints)
dynamicConstraints.append(contentsOf: indigoOptionalConstraints)
```
Here, a list of activated constraints of type `[NSLayoutConstraint]` is returned to us. We can save the result in `dynamicConstraints` variable.\
<br>

### 2. Update Constraints
```swift
// Deactivate optional constraints
dynamicConstraints.deactivateAll()

// Set new constraints
[pinkSquare, indigoView].forEach { $0.centerIn(superview: view) }
```
Here, we‚Äôre deactivating our optional constraints, then, adding new constraints.
